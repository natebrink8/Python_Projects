# OBJECTIVE
Being new to Python, this project will be critical in my growth as a developer.

# PYTHON PROJECTS
This project will consist of Python code learnings in the bootcamp efforts through The Tech Academy.
Specifically, on this bootcamp course, the following Projects were performed:
1.  File Transfer GUI<br>
    This project introduced the basics of Python in creating an interactive portal for a user to run the script, select a source and a destination folder path to check for files and to transfer those files, including a 24 hour retrospect for newly created or updated files in the source directory.
2.  Django University<br>
    A project to work through the editing of PY files to determine how those updates impact an introductory level website, creating course details to ensure the creation, editing, and deletion of records through the admin console.
3.  Hotel Website Tutorial<br>
    This project provided additional learning in the Python code I edited in Pycharm, navigating a web of PY files and how they interact with each other to get to the site, which created CSS-formatted pages that could be gone through for the maintenance of our phony hotel's menu!
4.  BlueBird Banking Checkbook Portal<br>
    This project was to setup an account creation and updating site. This allowed for the user to create their account, then add transactions, and view an account history of the transactions within the account.
